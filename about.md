My name is Scott Persinger, and this blog collects some of my personal and professional reflections. I am a Bay Area native, married father of three. I was a co-founder at Alier, Remixation, and Cloudconnect. More recently I held engineering leadership positions at Heroku, Stripe and now head up engineering at [Tatari](https://tatari.tv).
